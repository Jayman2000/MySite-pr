# My Website

This is the repo for Clayton’s [website](https://claytoneasley.org/)
All of my projects, ideas, thoughts and other random things are stored.


## Preview from source

To test out the site using what’s a available in this repo, here’s what you have
to do:

1. Make sure that [Python](https://www.python.org/) is installed.
2. `cd` to the [`src`](./src) directory.
3. Run `python -m http.server`.
4. Open `http://0.0.0.0:8000/` in a Web browser.


## See any problems on my site?

Feel free to make a pull request regarding the issue that you see.

## Frameworks I am using ?

I'm currently using [Wing CSS](https://kbrsh.github.io/wing/) but might change it to [Spectre css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/index.html) in the future. Both are designed to be lightweight and responsive.

## How is my site hosted ?

I got the domain from [epik](https://registrar.epik.com/) and a vps from [vultr](https://www.vultr.com/)

Thanks to Luke Smith's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dIVesHEAzc) for helping in the process.
